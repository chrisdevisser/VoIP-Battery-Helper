# VoIP-Battery-Helper
Turns off the cell radio while connected to WiFi. This is different from Airplane Mode in that it affects only the cell radio, not Bluetooth or WiFi. Do not use this app if you need to receive texts and calls. The use case is that you have a VoIP app like TextNow and don't use an actual calling/texting plan.

This app must be a system app. Boot into recovery and then copy the apk to /system/priv-app/VoipBatteryHelper.

This app requires Marshmallow despite the target version being Lollipop. I might fix this eventually.
