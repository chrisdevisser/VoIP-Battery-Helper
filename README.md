# VoIP-Battery-Helper
Turns off the cell radio while connected to WiFi. This is different from Airplane Mode in that it affects only the cell radio, not Bluetooth or WiFi.

This app must be a system app. Boot into recovery and then copy the apk to /system/priv-app/VoipBatteryHelper.

This app requires Marshmallow despite the target version being Lollipop. I might fix this eventually.
